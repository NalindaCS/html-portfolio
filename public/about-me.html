<h2>About Me</h2>
<hr />
<p>Hello! I’m Nalinda Sandaruwan, an entrepreneur with a passion for tourism and customer-centric experiences. With years of expertise in sales and marketing within the Sri Lankan tourism sector, I’ve been fortunate to curate personalized round and day tours that cater to a diverse clientele. My professional journey also includes product development, strengthening supplier relationships, and mastering the intricacies of Microsoft Excel.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m diving into the world of web development while building two exciting ventures: One's Destination (a travel brand) and SpicedLyfe (a lifestyle brand). Always eager to learn and innovate, I’m on a mission to craft memorable experiences that blend travel, culture, and style.</p>
